# FatSecret integration for Home Assistant

This is a custom [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) integration that connects to the [FatSecret API](https://platform.fatsecret.com/platform-api) to fetch your nutrition data for today (calories, macros, etc.) and expose them as sensors.

## Notes

- Requires a FatSecret API account to obtain the `Consumer Key` and the `Consumer Secret` when installing the integration.
- Data is fetched for the current day.
- Sensors update every 15 minutes.
